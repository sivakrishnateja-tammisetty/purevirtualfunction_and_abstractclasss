PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION:
                      .It is not to write any function definition and only we have to declare it.
                      .pure virtual function is declared and assigned by 0 in the declaration.

ABSTRACT CLASS:
                .A class which has at least one pure virtual function.
                .The classes inheriting the abstract classes must provide a definition for pure virtual function,otherwise subclass also become an abstract class.
                .Abstract class means incomplete (no definition).
                .Its not possible to create object for abstarct class,because the abstract class doesn't contain definition.so we can access pure virtual function with the help of base class pointer.
